As the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe , he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare .
One former bailiff charged that the judge double-crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $ 500 bribe .
That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas .
Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says Maurice Geiger , founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier , Vt. , a public interest group that researches rural justice issues .
It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters .

This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan , after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits , has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits , ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao , a minicar sold only in Japan .
No wonder .
All three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins .
So far , Nissan 's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential .
Nissan started advertising Infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit American showrooms .
`` When I saw the Lexus sales projections , I got worried , '' confesses Takashi Oka , who led the Infiniti development team .
But on reflection , Mr. Oka says , he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus .
Despite plans to add two new Infiniti models next year , bringing the total to four , Infiniti wo n't show profits for at least five years , he adds .
But Nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year , a modest increase of 4.7 % .

An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $ 60 million and $ 100 million in back pay , a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization .
An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan . ''
In a statement to employees , Eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling .
Eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts .
An earlier plan , which had received the creditors ' approval in July , fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan .

Based on 1988 sales , Georgia-Pacific ranked third at $ 9.51 billion , behind Weyerhaeuser Co. at $ 10 billion and International Paper Co. at $ 9.53 billion .
At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects .
One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ 3 billion .
Moreover , some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than Georgia-Pacific to end up acquiring Nekoosa , signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive .
But many analysts believe that , given the attractiveness of paper companies ' cash flows , as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe , there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months .
Some predicted that Nekoosa will end up being owned by a Japanese company .

The campaign , a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights , does n't mention cigarettes or smoking ; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since 1971 .
But even before it begins , the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates , who criticize Philip Morris 's attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of American democracy .
Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments , `` this has nothing to do with cigarettes , nor will it ever , '' the spokesman says .

From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486 , the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around .
It is time-consuming ( the abortion part alone lasts three days , and the clinical part comprises a week 's worth of visits ) , bloody ( one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion , although for most it resembles a menstrual period , with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days ) , and painful ( many women require analgesic shots to ease them through ) .
A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486 .
Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question .

Furthermore , because timing is so critical with RU-486 , she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she is pregnant , but just how pregnant she is .

But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy .
His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones .

Maureen Fraser , an economist with W.I. Carr , a subsidiary of France 's Banque Indosuez , believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997 .
`` Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997 , '' she says .
The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect Hong Kong to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos .
Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong 's economy .
One concerns Japanese investors .
But if the Japanese return in force , their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors ' waning commitment .
Indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong 's economic rhythm .

Thursday , a judge is scheduled to rule on Warner 's motion seeking to block the Guber-Peters duo from going to Columbia .
The battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this Hollywood dogfight .
Warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations , but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired .
So far , however , Sony has n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands .
That , says Warner 's Mr. Rabinowitz , is `` a total 100 % lie . ''
Mr. Guber says he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel .
`` Mr. Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia , '' Mr. Guber says .
He says he told Mr. Guber he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner . ''
For example , he says that since 1985 , he and Mr. Peters have developed over 85 movie projects , and Warner has `` passed '' or chosen not to produce at least 76 .

Polly Peck , a fast-growing British conglomerate , will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million ) for 39 million new shares of Sansui , a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions .
Japanese government officials , eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan .
Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .
`` Attitudes { toward being acquired } are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , '' Mr. Murasawa said .
Last month , Polly Peck posted a 38 % jump in pretax profit for the first half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63 % rise in sales .

That acquisition , to be completed by year end , will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines , making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets .
It 's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring : P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear .
Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives .
Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research .
P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business .
The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics .

Mr. Carpenter says he will return Kidder to prominence as a great investment bank .
In 1988 , Kidder eked out a $ 46 million profit , mainly because of severe cost cutting .
But even that niche is under attack , as several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors .
More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since January .
Still , without many actual deals to show off , Kidder is left to stress that it finally has `` a team '' in place , and that everyone works harder .
The result : Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies , much closer to the clientele of Goldman , Sachs & Co. than a serve-the-world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
Theoretically , the brokers will then be able to funnel `` leads '' on corporate finance opportunities to Kidder 's investment bankers , possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps .

They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . ''
`` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares .
Whatever the outcome of a test case , President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would `` antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans , '' says Louis Fisher , a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who specializes in executive-legislative relations .

But Mr. Ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him , effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters .

While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question , rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration , Mr. Ortega 's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue .

According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely caused by burning of fossil fuels , will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space .

Even the biggest auto shows in the U.S. are largely regional affairs , but the Tokyo show is international .
Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .
Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .

The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a U.S. airline , even a straight cash purchase .
The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind. ) and Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed .
In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy .
But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value .
Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate , currently about 4 1/2 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . ''
He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily .
Reps. Hamilton and Dorgan also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the Treasury secretary to the 12-member Fed committee that makes monetary policy .
While each of the Hamilton-Dorgan proposals represents only a small step , together they would erode the Fed 's independence , Mr. Greenspan said .

Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college-sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it .
The school was the first , in 1987 , to receive the NCAA 's `` death penalty '' -- two years without football -- for repeated rules violations .

Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility . ''
By contrast , in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union .
The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency .
Unless the laws determining the noteholder 's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes , however , a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars .

A beaming Mr. Pilson announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon .
How could CBS get pushed into outbidding itself ?
ABC , a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. , and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts .
Advertisers already are balking at higher prices .
Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over .
And they 've bought one . ''
Next month , talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .
And the winners will be the colleges , not either network .
Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender .
In the mid-1980s , after ABC had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 Winter Games , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices .
They gleefully await the `` dream season '' in 1990 .
Though CBS might move up to No. 2 in household ratings , most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49 .
It alone is n't likely to stop a station from dumping CBS shows .
`` You 've got to judge where the network will be in three years . ''
Nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional value .
Yet CBS will air only 12 regular-season games , 26 fewer than ABC and NBC .
If the playoffs end in four-game sweeps , losses could soar .
Advertisers are resisting higher prices , which would help close the gap .
Barry Frank , the agent who took Mr. Pilson to lunch last March , says that even if CBS loses , say , $ 10 million , it matters little .
`` It does n't mean anything -- it 's public-relations money . ''
Place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line .
On the corporate side , companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
The practice is common at catalog , insurance and phone companies , banks and telemarketers , according to trade groups and worker organizations .
The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system , he says , `` to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . ''
Both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped .
The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat .
But opponents , led by the CWA , say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81 % of monitored workers are n't represented by unions .
The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress .
`` Nine to Five , '' a Cleveland-based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill , six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses .

Analysts have predicted strong pent-up demand for the new line among Digital 's customers .
Large Digital buyers say the new VAX will let them stay with Digital when they need the power of a mainframe , instead of turning to IBM .
Digital also plans to compete fiercely with IBM when the giant 's customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses .
The fourth quarter is always IBM 's biggest by far , with most sales coming in December as customers seek to use budgets before year end .
That should help IBM address the damage that a resurgent Storage Technology Corp. has inflicted in that market .

As a presidential candidate in 1980 , George Bush forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published that March .
He 's totally geared to a punitive position . ''
Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush , who , Mr. Sears maintains , lacks a strong ideological base .
Running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother .
In April 1986 , then-Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape , incest and life endangerment , but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case .
He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund .
Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act .
Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act .
Without legal recourse , there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone .

`` I know it 's not over , '' a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd. , USX 's partner in a steel mill in Lorain , Ohio .
Nevertheless , Mr. Corry , once named chief executive , did n't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss , who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the USX tower in Pittsburgh .
The executive recalls Mr. Corry whispering to him and others , `` Remember , this was Dave 's deal . ''
Mr. Corry learned presence under fire when , as vice president of corporate planning , he handled what Mr. Johnston calls `` don't-con-me '' negotiations that led to USX 's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction .
When negotiating , Mr. Corry played his cards close to the vest .
Johnnie Johnson , who worked for Mr. Corry in strategic planning , recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates .
`` What he really wanted to know was about a particular company , but you did n't know that .
USX , he noted , was formed 88 years ago , `` by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies ... .

Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired .
Shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary , to single-A-1 from double-A-3 , citing problems in the company 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio . ''
As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he said .
An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some $ 44 million .
Mr. Kriz of Moody 's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year .
Instead , a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on `` an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods , '' which account for roughly two-thirds of Sears 's annual merchandise volume .
Moreover , the number of people who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in Sears declined to 16 % in September from 33 % in March .

Worse , the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so , but are resold eventually ( because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc . ) to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again .
The southern unemployment rate rose to 21.3 % in July from 21.2 % in April and from 20.6 % a year earlier .

Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $ 800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations .
The Japanese government does n't allow this .
The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does not act on behalf of students .
This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .

A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads .
By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree , according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton .
Compared to the Red Delicious , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less-perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinges of red .
To hear most U.S. growers tell it , we 'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve .
It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots .
Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact .
The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to growers .
Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs .
`` I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years , '' he adds .
Mr. Broderick , the Massachusetts grower , says the `` big boss '' at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine .
`` Taste has finally come to the fore , '' he says .
Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows .
These figures omit secondary guarantees , deposit insurance , and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises ( a huge concern in its own right , as detailed on this page May 3 ) .
Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time .
Guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully .
The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government .
Without such reforms , credit programs will continue to be a large-scale , high-risk proposition for taxpayers .
Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would be allowed to continue under certain conditions .
`` But I 'm recognizing there 's a good chance they 'll do a bit better than that , '' she says .

-- Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar , reported in Tass , June 10 , 1988 .
Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo .
It 's not enough .
Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet , the Soviet Union 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat .

Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S. , possibly as soon as next month , say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy .
Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver .

At first UAL did n't open because of an order imbalance .
Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out , the two Benjamin Jacobson specialists at the Big Board 's UAL trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all .
`` Options traders , arbitrage traders -- everyone , '' said Mr. Bates , cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday .
Big Board traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $ 150 a share entered by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which was active in UAL stock all day , is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon .
Already entered in the Big Board 's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares .
And at 9:15 , they posted a $ 135 to $ 155 `` first indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open .

But it has left holders of SCI TV 's junk bonds holding the bag , including some heavyweights that KKR might need to finance future deals , such as Kemper Financial Services , First Executive , Columbia Savings & Loan and Prudential Insurance Co. of America .
KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out , then later sold Storer 's cable operations at a fat profit .
In 1987 , KKR for the second time piled debt onto Storer 's TV stations , selling them for $ 1.3 billion to a new entity that was 45%-owned by KKR and 55%-owned by Gillett Corp. , which now operates the SCI TV stations .
On Storer as a whole , KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60 % in the three years it owned Storer .
The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar , according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York , which trades distressed securities .
They add that it is n't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out , which they think contributed to SCI TV 's current problems .
But others say junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting SCI TV into bankruptcy-law proceedings .

Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .

Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic , not unheroic , though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners , like Britannia herself , still ruled the waves .
Despite his racial advantage , to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one 's pantry is `` not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle . ''
If , for example , in the midst of a great social occasion ( such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 ) , one 's 72-yearold father , himself a great butler once , should happen to die of a stroke , one must continue to serve the port : `` Please do n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment .

The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of steel , radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets .
An ebullient Kenneth Iverson , Nucor 's chairman , says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours , compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill .
`` We 've had the Russians and Chinese , and people from India visiting us , '' Mr. Iverson beams .
It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market -- the major steelmakers ' largest , most prized , and until now , untouchable , market .
Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting , which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces .

In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June 4 killings in Beijing , an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ 55 million credit for a Shanghai property project .
Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the move .
While some commercial lending has resumed , international lenders remain nervous about China 's economic troubles and foreign debt -- $ 40 billion at the end of 1988 .
But in a letter sent in August to Asia Development , Schroders said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management committee on time , according to officials close to the project .
Creditors involved in the project contend , however , that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations .

`` When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you 're buying fewer shares , '' he says .
But a lower bid could face rejection by the UAL board .
Mr. Trump , who vowed Wednesday to `` go forward '' with the bid , said he was dropping it `` in light of the recent change in market conditions . ''
`` He 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it .
Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives .
Between then and his bid on Oct. 5 , the price fluctuated between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375 .
Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a share , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 .
UAL 's board could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n't any competing bids .
Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders .
