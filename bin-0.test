They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants .
In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds .
Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant .
He said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops .
He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids , the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers , which costs U.S. seed producers about $ 70 million annually .

Testifying before a House subcommittee , Mr. Mulford said that if the Treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have `` unhinged financial markets .

Mr. Mulford , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . ''

Although poison pills come in different colors and shapes , they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically , if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation 's stock .
Institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill .
Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy ?
If the answers to these questions are affirmative , then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill .
However , the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted , they survive forever .
Although the five-year strategy may be excellent , what will be the strategy in 25 years ?

The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business .

Mr. Wathen also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself , who 'd spent his whole career in the security business , could run Pinkerton 's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker .

Indeed , Mr. Gorbachev 's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism , whose architects spoke specifically of a `` third way '' : of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism .
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an `` organic '' society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified , and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation .
To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition .
At the same time , he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed .
By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher , and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods , Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party .

`` Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level .
Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .
To date , scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors .
There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families .
They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .
Their report galvanized other molecular biologists .
When they found it last winter , Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over .
Despite that , when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. Levine 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene .
Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too .
The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .
In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .
At the same time , the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes .
Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer .
Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too .
It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far .

The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product .
Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her `` These Boots are Made for Walkin ' '' song in the ad .
At that time , the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law , which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances .

One of the studies , done at the University of Minnesota , tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels .

The 190-point plunge in the stock market Oct. 13 has heightened concerns about volatility .
Last Tuesday , Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services Inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage , including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on Friday .
Though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers , Morgan Stanley 's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as Kidder , Peabody & Co. that still do such trades for their own account .
Indeed , Morgan Stanley 's president , Richard B. Fisher , said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators , investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially induces stock-market volatility .

Mr. Price `` wanted to run the MTM business '' and may have regretted selling the company to TVS , suggested Charles Denton , managing director of Zenith Productions , a subsidiary of Carlton Communications PLC , London .
The $ 320 million purchase of MTM represented an audacious international move for TVS , which then was about half the U.S. concern 's size .
Mr. Gatward has spent a lot of time since late September at MTM 's headquarters ; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives , according to the TVS spokesman .
TVS blames difficulties in peddling reruns of MTM shows to U.S. broadcasters for the problems at MTM .
Mr. Price co-founded MTM in 1969 with U.S. actress Mary Tyler Moore and Grant Tinker , her then-husband .

Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company 's sales , led to huge losses and left Akzo 's survival in doubt .
During the same period , the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets .
The fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20 % of Akzo 's sales .
`` Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit , '' said Jaap Visker , an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV .
For example , Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations , is small in plastics and does n't make fertilizers .
Thus , while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics , it has less to fear from the current slump .
Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints , auto finishes and industrial coatings .
In August , for example , it completed the $ 110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc. , a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood , metals and plastics , from Tyler Corp .
So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher .

Mr. Phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the WPP takeover .
And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat/Day/Mojo executive , Bill Hamilton , to try to bolster its work , `` Graham has to get the revenue of that New York office moving , '' says James Dougherty , an analyst with County NatWest Securities .

Zurich-based magazine Bilanz lists Mr. Rey as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs .

Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization .
That , he said , is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business : It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to .

Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
Often , Mr. Dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , critics claim .

Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic , and he modeled his work on Western classics .
In one sense , this limits him ; unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez , who has a distinctive Latin voice , Mr. Mahfouz 's style offers little that can be labeled `` Egyptian . ''
But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible , as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens 's London or Dostoevski 's St. Petersburg .

At a news conference , Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice .
The chairman said his board members , including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital .
At the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas 's bid .
That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50 % stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte 's insurance business .
Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 % .
Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital all strongly support him , but some analysts said they are n't so sure .
Paribas says it will offer 1,850 francs ( $ 296.95 ) each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights , and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1 , which will receive only partial dividends this year .

But as Congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against Beijing , the already-tense relationship could get worse .
The communication Mr. Lee brought represents the softer line the U.S. has been hoping to hear from Chinese officials since the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing .
The Chinese leader , Mr. Lee informed Mr. Bush , expressed some regret for what had happened in Beijing and conceded that China 's officials bore some responsibility .

We scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports richly earned , but also that it could be corrected .
Competition could be maintained -- and stadiums probably would remain full -- if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students , we said .
Which was about what Mr. Shields did , and quietly , until he resigned a few years later , pleading ill health , when the stuff hit the fan .
One wonders how other college athletic officials would behave under the same circumstances .
Under Massachusetts tax laws , corporations must pay 9.5 % of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities , including warranties , customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships .
Stores in upper-income neighborhoods , for instance , will carry high-priced wines , publications such as Vanity Fair , gourmet pasta sauces , oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products .
One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie , its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a `` significant '' drop next year in sales of its core product .
In any case , supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted , the company added .
Another option for Delmed , the company said , is that it could sell its plant in Ogden , Utah .
This picture is about a middle-aged son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies .
So it 's entirely possible that `` Look Who 's Talking '' is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now .
Finally , there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its stars are bears .
To be sure , one wonders what kind of man is this , who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling .
But then , even a great many words could n't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who adopts a parent .
In 1988 , the company earned $ 822.8 million , or $ 5.66 a share , on sales of $ 12.49 billion .

But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
For its part , NIH insists that its guidelines `` should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use . ''
NIH staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures .
Among other provisions , the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research .
Indeed , institutions already are taking note .

At that time , Sam Merksamer , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file .
In a statement , Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season , necessitated our filing Chapter 11 . ''
Now it 's on the fence .
It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning .
Yesterday , PaineWebber declined comment .
Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation .
As a result , competitors say Renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market , rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in Treasury bills .
It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company .
But a majority of the board , which includes three members from the Australian company , overrode him .
In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone .
In over-the-counter trading , MGM Grand was bid at $ 17.50 a share .
Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year : They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market , and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money .
`` That 's really where the leverage hurt , '' says Thomas Herzfeld , a Miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds .
Consider the New America High Income Fund .
That 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio , whose total return ( bond-price changes plus interest ) has amounted to a negative 6.08 % .
But when the market moves against the fund , investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged .
Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash .
One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now , in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett .
Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb .
Last year she boasted to HG magazine : `` I 'd never looked at a garden in my life . ''
The labels were breathy : `` Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design ... a rose garden , herb garden , serpentine garden , flower fields , an apple orchard ... organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form ` rooms ' ... here and there are simple architectural forms , a whimsical jet of water , a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid , and chairs of every sort to drag around ... .
One she made into a topiary rec room , replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger , TV , piano and chairs .
In another , she requisitioned topiary MX missile cones -- costing $ 10,000 each -- in heights up to 20 feet .
Then , to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms , Ms. Bartlett had thrown up windowless walls ( brick , lattice , hedge ) eight to 10 feet tall , casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade .
The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small ` rooms ' insure ... that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime . ''
Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals , Ms. Bartlett 's South Gardens design somehow continues on , seemingly impervious to reason , stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications .
( Mr. Quennell has said he plans to go with the grid , regardless . )
It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined .

Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico .

A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .

ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ?
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . ''
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
`` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . ''
Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .
First , a pop quiz .
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
Risk is also a function of time .
That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time .
For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
By retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio .
There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range . )

`` The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days , '' says Scott Stapf , director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association .
For most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says Barbara Roper , who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America , a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington .
The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend .
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
Two such actions , both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta , could be particularly embarrassing to the industry : both name J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP , as defendant .

First , generalize .
Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
Sounds great -- or does it ?
The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?
At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . ''
I call her agent , David Dominici .
I do n't like the sound of that .

It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud .
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .

Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group , which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union , failed to obtain financing for the $ 6.79 billion transaction .

The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .

Indeed , conservative investors , many of them elderly , have poured more than $ 50 billion into such funds , which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options , a gambler 's game .
For example , `` no load '' mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission .

More recently , Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner , for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes , the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest .
Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` Gorillas in the Mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work .
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony .
In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM/UA .
Meanwhile , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions .
The process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .

Merkur was originally aimed at enticing into Lincoln-Mercury dealerships the kind of young , affluent buyers who would n't be caught dead in a Town Car -- a vehicle so bargelike that Ford is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car 's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in Norfolk , Va .
