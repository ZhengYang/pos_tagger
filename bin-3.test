If Japanese companies are so efficient , why does Kawasaki-Rikuso Transportation Co. sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to Osaka ?

There also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers .

Wall Street is understandably skeptical .
Mr. Carpenter , a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for `` task forces , '' says he has done a `` complete rethink '' of Kidder in recent months .

THE YALE POLITICAL UNION does n't pay an honorarium to speakers .
Whatever one thinks of the idea , it 's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance .
White House spokesmen last week said Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power , exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right .
Those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating .
But there may be another problem with the device : Despite all the political angst it would cause , it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit .

When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins .
The soft-spoken , silver-haired Manhattan borough president -- the first black man to win the Democratic nomination for mayor here -- does n't have a single prominent political enemy .
They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cronies who may seek a place at the trough .
He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody .
Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the Dinkins camp to get Mr. Carson to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder -- protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate .
Later , Mr. Dinkins became more deeply indebted to Mr. Sutton and other city pols , including then-City Council President Paul O'Dwyer , when they helped him get appointed city clerk , a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau , among other things .
David Garth , Mayor Koch 's longtime media adviser , says of Mr. Dinkins , `` He really is the personification of the patronage system .
`` He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m. , I 'll give him that , '' says Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard .
But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his position .
When he later sided with striking hospital workers , some allies cringed a little more , concerned that Mr. Dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees .
In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents .
Mr. Dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists , leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential .

The Federal Communications Commission allowed American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market .
The FCC moves were good news for AT&T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation .
`` It means that Sikes is serious about the deregulation of long distance , '' said Jack Grubman , a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , who attended the FCC meeting .
AT&T gave a 5 % to 10 % discount to the Memphis , Tenn. , company that oversees Holiday Inns , in response to a similar discount offered to Holiday Corp. by MCI Communications Corp .
But the agency specifically did n't rule whether AT&T had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users .
Apart from those two actions , Mr. Sikes and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how AT&T is regulated since competition has increased .
US Sprint said was it will petition the FCC decision in federal court .
Separately , AT&T filed a countersuit against MCI accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising .

Billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds , undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market .
In the past two months the nation 's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $ 6 billion -- more than 15 % of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares , Dalbar says .
Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems .
But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years .
The $ 1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $ 150 million in the past two months .
About $ 60 million streamed out last week alone , double the level of the week following last month 's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze .
Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19 , Lipper says ; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 % .
Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers .

Unless Mr. Lawson 's resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy -- Mrs. Thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System 's exchange-rate mechanism , Mr. Lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates , Mr. Chandross concluded .

But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ?
Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole .
The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .
The Fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious .
It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell IBM or General Motors shares .
The Fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the banks .

IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the spokeswoman said , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays .
Intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines .

Yesterday 's vote on Japanese-American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision , which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988 .
As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders .

And the vacillation did n't end there .
The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal , increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue .

Indeed , Mr. Corry , at an August press conference , talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and `` not a day longer . ''
Moreover , the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be gone , for now .

Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury .
A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ''

If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them .
By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries .

Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .

Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .

Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year .
Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance .

The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .

In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned . ''
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish ( though that is clearly desirable ) than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work .
They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .

The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates ( mainly employment or hours ) instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .
Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year .
While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .

At Lloyd 's of London , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper .
Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .

In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one .
The title of chief executive officer is n't used .
While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many .
Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .
Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms .
In an interview a few months ago , he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues .
But it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency .

Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy .
Alexander Brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations .

Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG .

Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
While some say the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale .
The Treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52 % , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on Oct. 10 .

At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal .
Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters .
Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic .
To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world .
Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line ( performing of course for all-white audiences ) .
Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai deux amours '' they wept .

The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin , takeover speculator Salim B.

The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document .
For now , defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans .
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co. , which manufactured the device .
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other .
Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts .
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 .

While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders , scheduled for release today , participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment .

At a private dinner Thursday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America .
And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve .
In an interview , Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk .
`` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says .
His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
Despite the junk market 's problems , Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found .

Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe .
Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan .
And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen .
Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .

Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons .
`` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly { Maidenform } is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York .
Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way .

But the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights .
Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins .
But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .
`` The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters .

As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door .
But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway .
Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre , when he goes the runway could go too .
Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand .
OPEC 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets .
Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out .

At that rate , a majority of OPEC 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said .

The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it .

2 ) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues ( programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large ) and attending to local issues ( constituency service and pork barrel ) .

Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level .

AMR Corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be `` disappointing '' as well , primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs .
Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988 .

Last week , Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members .
Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor , and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units .
Even suburban Prince George 's County , Md. , reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year , most of them drug-related .
Until then , the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted .
It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there .
The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed , quite literally , a city whose larger structures had been built with sand .
The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference .
The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them .
Hence the LBO craze .

Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change .
Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .
Moreover , both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy .
East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz , in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church .
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow .
The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians , in contrast , declared their intentions to reform , while doing nothing concrete about it .

Mr. Steinhardt , who runs about $ 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners , made his name as a gunslinging trader , moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients .

Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates .
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .
In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival .
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega 's half-brother , a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado .
Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says .
The head of the DEA at the time , John Ingersoll , scotched the assassination plan .

For instance , he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party .

According to one person present at the meeting , Eastern 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . ''
In July , Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size .
It could n't sell its South American routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal .
Both said the new plan would n't work .
Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said .
The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .
Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats .

Bofors says it ca n't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality .

`` They still bear the memory of October 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. Nichols said .
At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold . ''
`` I do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $ 10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so , '' he said .

Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since 1979 .

In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates .
Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons .
It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI .
And while the defense secretary is speaking out , President Bush himself has n't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support , as President Reagan did .
As a result , Frank Gaffney , a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy , charges that the administration 's `` professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity . ''
Still , proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev .
All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm .
`` What I 'd like to see , if he is up to it , is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI , '' the congressman says .
Mr. Allen , appointed by President Reagan , grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies .
Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman . ''
Rep. Don Edwards , the California Democrat , warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction . ''
Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again , which somehow elevated the vague concept of `` Indian rights '' above the rights of individual Indians .
There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen 's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups .

But most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly .
Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert .
On Monday , for instance , Howard Ward , a principal at Scudder , Stevens & Clark , found that `` you could n't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up . ''
And when many firms had to `` pay up , '' Monday 's sudden rally was sparked .
`` It 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy '' -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market .
By contrast , traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves .

Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers .
In particular , a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade .
For example , although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been statutorily defined .
In 1983 , the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision , which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain `` some personal gain '' and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact .
Essentially , Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out , when he was told by another prominent trader , Bernard `` Bunny '' Lasker , that the deal was in trouble .
Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain ?
