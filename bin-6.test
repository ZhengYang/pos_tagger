Today , the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work ( though a touch of the old Tashi still survives ) and now goes on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exceptions .
And so it went through the first half : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would disturb or challenge a listener .
An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas , beginning with `` Golden Rain , '' a lilting , laid-back lead in to the uptempo `` Sky , '' which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers .

Last March , nine months after the judge 's swearing-in , the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of `` official oppression '' in Cambria County , a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania .
According to testimony in a public , 80-page grand-jury report handed up to the state attorney general , Judge O'Kicki extorted cash from lawyers , muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for more than a decade .
Prosecutors , in an indictment based on the grand jury 's report , maintain that at various times since 1975 , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship ; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set up a dummy corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend ( now his second wife ) ; and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in Cambria County .
He graduated near the top of his class , serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh , who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and , now , U.S. Attorney General .
`` He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former president of Cambria County 's 150-member bar association , who , like most lawyers in Cambria County , refuses to talk about the judge publicly .
`` He 's sharp as a tack .
He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ''
`` What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society , the banks and the bar association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat , a newspaper in nearby Johnstown , shortly after the scandal became public .
`` Nobody had the guts to complain . ''
Visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the years , months , weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge , giving Judge O'Kicki the seniority required to take over as the county 's top court administrator .
`` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . ''
When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac in Ebensburg five years ago , the dealership had `` certain apprehensions '' about the judge 's reputation , according to the grand-jury report .
Then , as an additional precaution , the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents .
The judge wrote again .
The bank acquiesced .
The bank , he wrote back , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by 3.5 % , `` as a concession to you . ''

The Internal Revenue Service said it is willing to let the U.S. Tax Court decide how much oil man William Herbert Hunt will owe the government after his assets are liquidated .
The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $ 251 million against Mr. Hunt .
The IRS had demanded $ 90 million but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $ 60 million .
Grover Hartt III , a government lawyer , warned that Mr. Hunt stood to lose certain oil and gas properties , $ 200,000 in English pottery , a Colorado condominium and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the IRS .
Japan has found another safe outlet for its money : U.S. home mortgages .
The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here .
Second , they are liquid .
That 's a headache for long-term investors , since it forces them to reinvest their money -- usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried .
Compounding the trouble to Japanese investors , mortgage securities pay interest monthly , since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments .
But Japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments , so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems .
In addition , further packaging of mortgage-backed securities , such as Blackstone 's fund , have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to .

`` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says Raymond Pettit , senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group .
Critics say Mitsubishi Estate 's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan .
First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share .
In asset terms , Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan .
Nonetheless , it will barely make a dent in Mitsubishi Estate 's finances , analysts say .

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $ 765 million will be depleted next year , and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations .
The trust , which was created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , ultimately expects to receive $ 2.5 billion from Manville , but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims .

Yutaka Kume , who took the helm as Nissan 's president in June 1985 , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed . ''
Desperately hoping to spark sales , Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships .
But when they arrived at the door , all were afraid to go in , fearing that they would be out of place .
Why ?
These days Nissan can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust .
To help close the gap , Nissan recently established a top-level cost-cutting committee .
That gives it an enviable strategic advantage , at least until its rivals catch up , but also plenty of managerial headaches .

Indeed , many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that Mr. Bush was n't interested in such an informal get-together .

Apple Computer Inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year .
But amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real-life PC .

`` Psyllium 's not a good crop , '' complains Sooraji Jath , a 26-year-old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura . ``
You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined . ''
The staff brags about psyllium 's hefty contribution to American regularity , without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol .
This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop .
Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel .
So when next year 's psyllium crop is harvested in March , it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom .
And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage .

China 's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong .
It may experience an upswing or two in between .
Since the China crisis erupted , Mr. Mushkat says , the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties Hong Kong currently faces .
The first instance occurred in 1967-68 , when China 's Cultural Revolution triggered bloody street rioting in the colony .
Given Hong Kong 's record , Mr. Mushkat 's `` realists '' might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago .

A two-day meeting of representatives of Cocom , the 17-nation group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries , did n't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls .
The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members , especially France , West Germany and Italy , to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools , which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members .
But this September -- just when many market economists , including some at Merrill Lynch , believed that Mr. Straszheim was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn .
And Mr. Straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that `` it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time . ''
Carrying the new message on the road , Mr. Straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client .
His new forecast calls for `` a soft landing . ''
This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind .
When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency .
The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40 % , the flow abroad of British capital slowed , to 50 billion pounds ( $ 79 billion at the current rate ) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 .
This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency .
Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s .

If this battle were a movie , the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do n't have much to gain from a protracted battle .
In that case , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially , but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner .
Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides ' current business dealings .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner , notably the Sylvester Stallone film `` Tango and Cash . ''
But Sony is a problem . ''
According to this theory , Warner executives , hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers , encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company .
But Mr. Guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used .
Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report .
The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $ 10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30 .

The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share .
Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again .
`` At some point , it will become non-economical for one company .
McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause .
We did n't think a sleeping { Bell } mentality would be willing to take on dilution . ''
But Kenneth Leon , a telecommunications analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares .
In national over-the-counter trading , LIN shares soared $ 4.625 to closed at $ 112.625 , while McCaw fell $ 2.50 a share to $ 37.75 .

`` They should call { the exchange } Trump East , '' charged Mr. Wohlstetter , the 79-year-old founder of Contel who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader .
Mr. Wohlstetter , for example , said he wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190-point Dow plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what I get back is gobbledygook . ''
The Big Board `` is partly to blame { for the price swings } , because they 're cowards , '' said Mr. Wohlstetter .
`` Their powerful members manage them . ''
The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .
`` They wo n't fight the listed companies .

`` There 's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher 's style of management has become a political liability , '' says Bill Martin , senior economist at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew .

U.S. and northern European diplomats confirm Mr. Korotich 's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger .
A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like Ogonyok is circulation .
But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are , there is a fragility to glasnost .
As late as the 1890s , the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines .
It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan 's wives .
`` I 'd be destroying myself , '' replies Mr. Korotich , who then asks , `` What would that accomplish ?
Larry Drury , attorney for the plaintiffs , valued the settlement at between $ 6 million and $ 8 million .
Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets .
At a hearing last week , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that `` Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement . ''
Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . ''
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system .
Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault .
The administration 's concerns are understandable .
Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled .
Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch .
The Justice Department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court , Judge H. Robert Mayer , a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago .

Southam Inc. said its unprofitable weekly newspaper , The Financial Times of Canada , is up for sale .
Southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas .

After 25 years in city politics , David Dinkins remains an enigma .

`` I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow , '' he said at the time .
The debt rose further in 1977 when Mr. Sutton resigned his position as Manhattan borough president to run for mayor .
Mr. Dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985 .

According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar 's case , prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure .

Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra .

Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ? '' Mr. Roman asked .
Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units .
He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives .

Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper .
Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca .
Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988 .

Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
`` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . ''
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide .
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
`` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . ''
When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way .
My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion .
So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market .
Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years .
My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .

One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz .
Bank officials , however , showed him the door , and the sale never came off .

Always .
The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
Another factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
In the year-earlier period , Colgate posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share .
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .

Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management .
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower .
Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
Another approach : An investor with $ 100 million might use $ 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .

When things are quiet ( low volatility ) , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
Fear is the father of panic .
And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers ( a result of some post-1987 crash studies ) also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .

In a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries .

`` Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says David Katz , chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York .
But whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions .
( Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health . )
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries .

Recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick .

If the refinancing plan clears Congress , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them .

Last year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
On this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
The state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs .
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago , along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. , its Houston-based fund raiser .
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
Attorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .

Not only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market value of the company .
Last week , following fruitless settlement talks , Warner , now merging with Time Inc. , filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected .
On that film , which is to start shooting in a few months , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script .
`` We 've had a few bombs , '' admits Mr. Peters .
Mr. Guber , by contrast , has been married to one woman for more than 20 years .
Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey , which became `` Gorillas in the Mist . ''
He says , `` Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey .
Ultimately , they paid more than $ 1 million for the rights .
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest . )
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive .
Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co .
And earnings have been erratic .
Guber Peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16.625 .
In any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman . ''
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .
Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
On a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year .
Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
`` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice president of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm .

In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management , Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings .
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of Mexican nationalism , to foreigners .
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 , the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's $ 97 billion foreign debt .

In the two weeks since the rebellion , which the U.S. hesitantly backed , Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in maintaining power .
America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship .
The woman had nearly died .
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them .
`` The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along , '' says Ambler Moss , a former Ambassador to Panama .
`` If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through 1988 , '' Mr. Moss contends .
Luis Carlos , knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer , relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors .
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , French-made uniform , Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life , friends from the period say .
`` He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism , where officers were the elite with special privileges , '' recalls Darien Ayala , a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend .
`` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation .
`` He started building the files that helped him gain power . ''
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control .
`` It was like a play on Broadway , '' recalls Mr. Martinez .
But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned , Mr. Noriega was a model recruit .
`` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . ''
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group .
They included one of Mr. Noriega 's closest friends and business partners , Carlos Wittgreen .
But now , along with reindicting Mr. Noriega 's pal , they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ 2 million in arms .
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega 's friend , Mr. Wittgreen , would be handling the shah 's security .
`` I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' Mr. Sanford says .
Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively .
He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges .
As Mr. Noriega 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the Contras , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington .
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges .
In late 1986 , he made an offer he thought the U.S. could n't refuse .
Mr. Noriega 's proposal was turned down .
`` For short-term gains , people were willing to put up with him .
