The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association argues , for example , in its lengthy letter to the SEC , that the proposed changes `` would substantially improve the { law } by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities . ''
What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time .

In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co .
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen .

The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley -- once a minor-leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia .

Such a countermove could end Jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and British-owned .
In a statement , Jaguar 's board said they `` were not consulted about the ( Ridley decision ) in advance and were surprised at the action taken . ''

What the Big Board is considering is re-establishing a `` collar '' on program trading when the market moves significantly .
It did n't work .
Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists , who make markets in individual stocks , and from many companies that have shares listed on the Big Board .
`` We are looking for representation we have n't had , '' a specialist said .
Many specialist firms resent the Big Board 's new `` basket '' product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index in one shot .

For the past decade , NEC Corp. has owned more than half the Japanese PC market and ruled it with near-monopoly power .
But early on , IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it .
Most rivals `` have a working relationship with NEC , often through cross-licensing of technology , '' the Japan Personal Computer Software Association noted recently .

Going by official forecasts of GDP , which measures the colony 's output of goods and services , minus foreign income , Mr. Mushkat 's `` realists '' seem relatively close to the mark .
`` We are n't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario , '' he says .
The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis .
As a result , many of those now planning to leave Hong Kong ca n't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate .
Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say .
In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant .
And while signs of an economic slowdown , softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market 's recent weakness , many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings .
The Wall Street firms ' pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional investors .
Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security .
But unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks , which invites frequent bouts of stock-index arbitrage in the first place .

The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate ( Jaclyn Smith ) , and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk , a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex .
I mean , these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen-ager , someone tied her hands behind her back , thrust her head into a gunny sack , brutally raped and beat her , and then left her to die in a cold-storage room .
At this point , the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy .
Take the scene in which Kate stands naked by a lighted window , whispering to her hidden assailant , `` Look all you want .

Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the U.S. , they are generally stable in Europe , Mr. Bergsma said .
Akzo also makes products derived from salt , such as chlorine and caustic soda .
But Akzo is still slimming down : It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany .
There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates .
And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians , who predict/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows .
We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience .
Perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another low-tax , deregulated , supply-side economy .
Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus .
Those who can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation , indeed , it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply .
All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy .
Better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience .

Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute .
Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark .
As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to gold or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining .
Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship .
Consequently , Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row .
This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle .

Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that Warner was `` taking over '' the picture , and another producer would be giving all of the orders .
Mr. Guber , in his affidavit , says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25 , Mr. Semel `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company . ''
Mr. Guber says that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said Mr. Ross was `` crazy because of the Time deal , '' meaning , Mr. Guber says , that Mr. Ross `` did not want to communicate to his new merger partner , Time Inc. , that Warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances . ''
Moreover , Mr. Guber claims , Mr. Semel told him that Mr. Ross probably would n't object `` if it were anybody other than Sony .

BellSouth 's `` back-end protection was flawed previously .

Indeed , McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement .
Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading .
Estimates from traders put it at less than 5 % of Nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares .
`` We were n't as concerned until they became sell programs , '' says Mr. DaPuzzo , who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility .
Of course , there were sell programs in past years , too , but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days .

This gap eventually closes , but slowly .
The average daily share turnover for October is almost 148 million shares .

National Convenience Stores Inc. , trying to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business , said it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores .
National Convenience 's move is likely to be echoed by other chains , though analysts note that Southland Corp. , owner of 7-Eleven stores , and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort .
Analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores , allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't .

For instance , Commonwealth BioVentures Inc. , a venture-capital concern , last month invested $ 600,000 to launch Amira Inc. , a Worcester , Mass. , concern that will produce pharmaceuticals .

And shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold .
Leveraged funds in particular `` are still extremely vulnerable , because we 're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market , '' says George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates in Northampton , Mass .

If a compromise ca n't be reached , the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists .
But at this point , that may just be wishful thinking .
The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company .
Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks .
`` Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union ? '' asks Candace Browning , an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Co .
`` Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots ? '' she adds .
In that way , the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake , or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal .
The group did n't make a formal offer , but instead told UAL 's advisers before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share .

McCaw 's offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow .
Last week , McCaw said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its bid to control LIN Broadcasting .
McCaw wants to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each , or $ 2.75 billion , which would result in McCaw 's owning 50.3 % of LIN .

One day last March , CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank met for lunch at the Lotos Club here .
Mr. Frank told Mr. Pilson that Olympics officials wanted $ 290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway .
CBS is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them .
A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise .
`` And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today . ''
In 1976 , he joined CBS Sports to head business affairs and , five years later , became its president .
`` Our competitors say we overbid them .
And the Winter Olympics will air during the February `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations .
Moreover , sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women .
Nor is CBS a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings .
Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited .
The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if CBS ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself .

While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past .
If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do , `` you ca n't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish , '' says one lawyer at a large New York firm .
`` Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available , '' said Jack Nusbaum , co-chairman of Willkie Farr .
What 's more , he said , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts .
Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed .
In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it .

Former USX Corp. Chairman David M. Roderick may have been lucky he retired last May .
An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up frogs , Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company `` that could do big things . ''
What miffed many USX executives and shareholders was that the acquisition , for $ 3 billion of stock , doubled the USX shares outstanding and considerably diluted them .
What 's more , the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as Texas Oil & Gas reported its first annual loss in 28 years .
The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned .
Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say .
`` Dave thought the country needed a strong U.S. Steel and , while Chuck agreed , he was more apt to say , ` Not at any cost to shareholders , ' '' a former executive says .
With Mr. Icahn breathing down his neck , however , Mr. Corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price , even if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards .
However , even USX executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals .
And then , `` he wo n't panic , '' says J. Bruce Johnston , a former USX executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with Adler Cohen & Grigsby in Pittsburgh .
Ever the pragmatist , Mr. Corry said in August that he realized that USX is on `` acquisition screens all over the country . ''

At the heart of Israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails .
The dollar finished lower yesterday , after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street .

Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America 's apple heap .
It certainly wo n't get there on looks .
More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety , America 's No. 2 apple .
`` Red Delicious has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' says Washington State 's Mr. Norton .
The scare over Alar , a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made consumers shy away from the Delicious , though they were less affected than the McIntosh .
`` A lot of growers wo n't be around in a few years , '' says Mr. Norton , although they have stopped using Alar .
Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty .
The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S. , sold mainly in fruit boutiques .

The weight of Lebanon 's history was also against him ; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating .

Cray jolted the market in July when it slashed revenue and earnings projections for this year , citing a slowing economy that has delayed orders from government as well as commercial customers .
The company made its 1990 projection -- an unusual event for Cray -- in announcing improved net income for the third quarter .
He added that the company expects `` strong '' operating profit for the year , `` but at a level significantly lower than last year . ''
He said 1989 's net income could be 11 % to 13 % of revenue , which , assuming current expectations , would be 40 % to 45 % below 1988 's level .
Noting that Cray does n't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of Convex Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , Mr. Luber said such a machine would be necessary `` to get things back on line here . ''

As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently .

The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency .
During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
Gen. Scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds .

Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .

`` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .

When it comes to buying and selling shares , Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
Institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .

The Tire King
Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did .
Newspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire king . ''
But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights .

Then a political novice , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers .
Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio .
By a 2-to-1 ratio , voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue .
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean .
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office .

All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations .
Such efforts -- unheard of only a few years ago -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $ 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry .
Last season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years .
One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier .
`` Ski school is great , '' cries out a tot , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope .
But in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the Angel Fire , Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts .
Since 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids .
`` Most parents who had to go through that never came back , '' says Michael Shannon , president of Vail Associates Inc. , which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts .
`` People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says Don Borgeson , executive director of Angel Fire , N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce .

His client , Mr. Davis , used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL ; Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group .
Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation , or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers .
The success of the NWA financing , and the failure of the UAL deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks .
Japanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt , according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner .
Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment .
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson , or seek representation on the company 's board .
Inland Steel Industries Inc. , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings .

Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a `` national market system '' ( not yet achieved ) almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
But I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets .
But a few experts , going against the consensus , do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing .
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. Confair adds .
In good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance .
`` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and { Chicago & North Western } is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . ''
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1/2 % coupon rate .
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
According to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address ...
Which , it should be added , does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .

Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist .
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year .

As part of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash .
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .
For example , we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago .
Wrong .
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 , 1987 , was just a big blip .
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock .
Either way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor .
Of the major New York-based securities firms , only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers .
`` It s almost product de jour , '' grouses one account executive at Dean Witter .
Getting out of them , however , may be a different story now .
Finally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did .

And they are a very odd team in any case .
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York .
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers .
In 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters , by then a successful producer in his own right , after the death of Mr. Bogart .
The studio says it stuck with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner . ''
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives , '' Mr. Daly said in his affidavit .
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues .
Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
`` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . ''
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
`` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . ''
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured .
In addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession .
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .

The 1986 tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill .

The rebel officer 's slow and painful death , at the headquarters of Panama 's Battalion-2000 squad , was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega , says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports .
Leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup , according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City .
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night , sometimes more than once a night .
Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades .

After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother , Indira Gandhi , Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride .
His `` Mr. Clean '' image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal , which will be a major campaign issue .

In 1977 , Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in power , she was restored to office .
The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress ( I ) Party is the poor reputation of the opposition .

More ominous to SDI supporters , the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars .
The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses .
But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty .
